[190618]
Added holding page for effiency/DCR/PCR
Added back to measurement type page buttons
Added back to instrument setup page buttons
Added matplotlib style 'ggplot'
Moved setup_data_gather function to WorkingPage to ensure cannot overwrite exisitng file by pressing start measuerement button
Fixed size_label bug
Added manual_atten flag to controller class - implement it in EDP page so not to look for attenuators if they're not there.

[210618]
Added average counts parameter to WorkingPage
Added wavelength parameter to WorkingPage
Implemented above in setup_data_gather method

[250618]
Added DCR page - NOT FINISHED
Added holding page for efficiency

[260618]
Finished DCR pages
Now reuses graph page from VvT pages
Needs tested
Added some efficiency pages
Not finished - requires looking at the way data is taken for each atten

[290618]
Filled in data gathering for efficiency functions
Need to complete graph function

[020718]
Graph function now parses efficiency data - returns dictionary of efficiency values for each bias and one bias array to the controller
Added graph page for effiency and callback to plot new graph if combobox value changed to a different attenuation

[060718]
Tried on zephynator PC - issues with pip and matplotlib for python3. Needs upgraded pip!? Error thrown regarding freetype and png libs.

[090718]
Added dual attenuator capability
Added return buttons to DCR/EFF pages
Bug fixes to DCR pages (Calls to controller.rm fixed + others)
Tests DCR page - still to test graphing

[100718]
Added .ico file
Various fixes to EFF and DCR pages to make work
Tested DCR and EFF with multiple attenuations. Works OK
Need to test with 2 attens
Need to test with known detector to check results.
Improved layout of Eff/DCR choice page
Changed all .ask to .query.
Changed NavigationToolbar2TkAgg to NavigationToolbar2TK as per depreciation warning.

[110718]
Added logging class to log exceptions - ENABLE WHEN DONE
Removed imports for python2
Put back NavigationToolbar2TkAgg as it wasn't working
Added attenuation calculator to efficiency page
Tested efficiency page in full.
Added base of 'Load other file' page.

[120718]
Moved the graphing functions outside of the classes so they are global 
Filled in graph other file pages

[130718]
New dev file 'MergedGraphFuncs' created
This takes the grphing funcs and merges them so there are only 2 - 1 for efficiency and 1 for everything else.
Replaced DCR_filename references with controller.Filename references
Now a list of titles for each data file (efficiency excluded)
Renamed the sim900 'query' back to 'ask' - forgot this is built in to Rob's class not pyvisa
Call destroy on the atten_val_box widget when a frame is reloaded - fixes bug where mutliple widgets spawned
Also called on VvT buttones - checks if exists (!= None) - not sure this will work.
Removed GraphSetupPage and chagned to call data extract from the 'Graph' button in VvT
Added 'Graph setup' popup for VvT.
Added lines that take the first 'title' from controller.data_titles from the ones that are plotted and sets that to be the axis labels. 
Changed destroy widgets line by checking if WIDGET.winfo_exists() == 1
Took time_arr out and just made it in regular dict. Added plotting for Y axis. 
Added colour cycler to plotting.

[160718]
Tested colour cycler
Tested variable X-axis
Added a try, except AttributeError to the deleting the graph specific buttons to account for if the self.widget has never existed.

[220818]
Added manual attenuation lines into the efficiency data gather function. Prompt to block and unblock fibre as neccessary instead of using attenuators automatically.

TODO:
Animate graph (maybe).
Add IV? - Point to Rob's program. (execfile?)
Keep two graphs up at once for comparison (ValVTime).
Jitter - open hydraharp software.
Possible condition where data will be taken when not wanted if not resetting program before taking VvT values. Need to reinitialise containers when setting up VvT



TO DO LOGGING:
Add size limit
